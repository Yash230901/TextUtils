TextUtils

This is the TextUtils website which is used for Text manipulation.

You can type your text in text box. 

There are some buttons available for your text manipulation like CONVERT TO UPPECASE, CONVERT TO LOWERCASE, REMOVE SPACES, CLEAR TEXT. 

This website is made using HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT,BOOTSTRAP and REACT JS. 

I have given dark or light mode for its navbar,later I will add full dark or light mode to website. 

And later,I will add more functionality to this website. There are two pages of website 1. HOME 2. ABOUT. 

I have used React Router to move one page to another without page reloading. 

Hope you will enjoy this website.
